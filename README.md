🧑🏽‍💻Hi there! My name is Raymond Karumba and I am an aspiring iOS developer.
💻 I have a strong foundation in computer science principles and am constantly learning new technologies and frameworks to improve my skills.

📱 My passion for mobile development started with creating my own apps for fun and has grown into a desire to create intuitive and seamless user experiences for others.

⚡️ I am highly motivated and constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

🌟 Some of my notable projects include:

A social networking app that allows users to connect with friends and join groups based on shared interests.
A task management app that utilizes the iOS calendar and reminders frameworks to help users stay organized.
🤝 I am always open to collaborating and learning from others in the development community. Feel free to reach out to me on GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn
